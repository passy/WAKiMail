WAKiMail v0.6
=============

  * Load mail list asynchronously for better performance.
  * Don't stop the mail fetching if the activity is closed. First of all, it 
    doesn't make sense to abort it when it's almost through. Secondly, there is
    a chance that the completed task tries to kill the already destroyed
    activity, causing the app to crash.

WAKiMail v0.5.2
===============

  * Fixed another race condition, this time in the mail detail view. Destroy
    events were not properly handled and could cause a null pointer
    dereference when the mail download task accessed the activity which has
    already been destroyed.

WAKiMail v0.5.1
===============

  * Fixed bug that caused the application to crash when rotating the screen
    while fetching mails and clicking the refresh button again and the sencond
    sync request finished before the first did.

WAKiMail v0.5
=============

  * Links in the mail body are clickable.
  * Some HTML tags in the mail get replaced.
  * Date in the detail view is correctly displayed (instead of showing just a
    timestamp)
