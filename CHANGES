WAKiMail v0.5.2
===============

    * Fixed another race condition, this time in the mail detail view. Destroy
      events were not properly handled and could cause a null pointer
      dereference when the mail download task accessed the activity which has
      already been destroyed.

WAKiMail v0.5.1
===============

    * Fixed bug that caused the application to crash when rotating the screen
      while fetching mails and clicking the refresh button again and the sencond
      sync request finished before the first did.

WAKiMail v0.5
=============

    * Links in the mail body are clickable.
    * Some HTML tags in the mail get replaced.
    * Date in the detail view is correctly displayed (instead of showing just a
      timestamp)
